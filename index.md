Hi there. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Computer Science][WMCS] at [William & Mary][W&M] under the supervision of [Dr. Bin Ren][BinRen].

My research interests lie in parallel computing with an emphasis on the design and optimization of parallel solutions for graph-based applications, relevant areas including:

* Parallel Computing
* High Performance Computing
* Graph Processing
* Compilers
* Deep Neural Network Inference

Before joining William & Mary, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in the [Department of Computer Science][HQUCS] at [Huaqiao University][HQU], China in 2013 and 2016, respectively. My master's research advisor is [Dr. Tian Wang][TianWang].
