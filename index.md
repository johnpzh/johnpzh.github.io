Hi there. I am a postdoc in the Future Computing Technologies Group (formerly known as [High-Performance Computing Group][HPCPNNL]) at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)][PNNL]. My mentor is [Dr. Roberto Gioiosa][RobertoGioiosa] and previously [Dr. Gokcen Kestor][GokcenKestor] (started her new posision at Barcelona Supercomputing Center). I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Computer Science][WMCS] at [William & Mary][W&M] under the supervision of [Dr. Bin Ren][BinRen].

My research interests lie in parallel computing with an emphasis on the design and optimization of parallel solutions for sparse computations and graph-based applications, relevant areas including:

* High-Performance Computing
* Compilers
* Machine Learning Optimization
* Continuum Computing

Before accepted to William & Mary, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in the [Department of Computer Science][HQUCS] at [Huaqiao University][HQU], China in 2013 and 2016, respectively. My master's research advisor is [Dr. Tian Wang][TianWang].
